# LAB1 – Git & GitHub for ML!

Hello! I'm Ghadeer Almudhi.

I am a Third Year Computer Science student, and I chose this major because I enjoy learning everything related to technology, coding, and how systems work. I am interested in Machine Learning because it seems exciting and challenging, and I want to learn how data and algorithms can be used to create smart solutions for real-world problems.
